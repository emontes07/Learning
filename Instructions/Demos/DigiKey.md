## Task 9 (FYI): Create or Replace an Excel Macro with Copilot

This advanced, **FYI-only** task demonstrates two ways to handle Excel
macro-style calculations using **Copilot Chat**: either by asking
Copilot to perform the calculation directly from an uploaded
spreadsheet, or by having Copilot help author or adjust a VBA macro for
Excel.

> **Heads-up:** VBA macros don’t run in **Excel for the web**, but
> Copilot Chat can still perform the same calculations from your
> uploaded workbook.

**How to use it:**

1.  Open a new browser tab and go to
    [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).
2.  Select **Copilot Chat**.
3.  Proceed with one of the two options below.

screenshot showing two macro approaches with Copilot

**Option 1 – Have Copilot perform the calculation from your file**

Upload your `Revenue.xlsx` (or a similar workbook with data) and ask
Copilot to perform the calculation directly, for example:

    Please create an Excel Macro script that performs the following task:  
    Calculate the total and average revenue from the "Sales by Product" worksheet. 

    For Excel web users, execute the equivalent calculation now on the uploaded file and report:  
    - Total Revenue  
    - Average Revenue

**Option 2 – Ask Copilot to draft/modify the VBA macro**

Alternatively, you can have Copilot assist with the VBA code itself. For
example, ask Copilot:

    Write a VBA macro that calculates the total and average revenue from the "Sales by Product" worksheet and displays the results in a message box.

    Now modify the script so it writes:  
    - Total Revenue to cell J4  
    - Average Revenue to cell J5  
    and formats both as currency.

> **Tip:** Here are some follow-up requests you can try with Copilot in
> this scenario:  
> - Explain what this macro does line by line.  
> - Convert this macro to a Copilot prompt that performs the same
> calculation without VBA.  
> - Add error handling if the specified sheet or column is missing.
>
> **Learning Outcome:**  
> You’ll understand two practical approaches to handle macro-style tasks
> with Copilot: (1) letting Copilot Chat run calculations directly on
> your data, or (2) having Copilot author or refactor a VBA macro for
> desktop Excel (including writing results to specific cells).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
