## What You’ll Do

You’ll perform several tasks to build Copilot skills:

1. **Research & Analysis**: Use Copilot Chat to gather insights from internal and external sources.
2. **Summarize & Structure**: Transform raw meeting notes into professional summaries.
3. **Refine with Follow-Up**: Practice enhancing results by asking iterative questions.
4. **Recap Emails**: Use Copilot in Outlook to extract key actions from email threads.
5. **Analyze Reviews & Visualize Sentiments**: Turn survey or review data into actionable insights and visuals.
6. **Visualize Financial Data**: Create charts and heat maps from sales data.

## Prompting Framework: GCSE

To get the best results from Copilot, use the GCSE framework: 

![Effective Prompt.](../Prompts/Media/Prompt%2001.png)  

- **Goal**: What do you want Copilot to do?
- **Context**: Why do you need it? Who is involved?
- **Source**: What information or samples should Copilot use?
- **Expectations**: How should Copilot respond? (Format, tone, detail)

**TIP:** If your prompt is too short, you’ll get generic results. If it’s too long, Copilot might miss instructions. Aim for clarity and specificity.

## Exercise: Perform Online Research

### Researcher: Build a Copilot Agent Governance Whitepapern

> **IMPORTANT:** Steps 1–4 should be completed at the beginning of the session to give Researcher enough time to complete the first prompt.

1. Open **Researcher** from the left navigation in the Copilot app.  

    ![Screenshot showing Researcher selected in M365 Copilot menu.](../Prompts/Media/researcher.png)  

1. Enter the following prompt:

    ```text
      Create a whitepaper outlining best practices for Copilot Agent Governance in enterprise environments.  
      Include sections on data access control, compliance with internal policies, lifecycle management,  
      and risk mitigation for custom copilots. Provide examples of governance frameworks used in  
      Microsoft 365 and Azure OpenAI integrations, and highlight lessons learned from early deployments.
    ```

1. Attach reference files using `/` (point to SharePoint/OneDrive):  

   - **/SprintCycle Charger Product Launch.docx**  
   - *(Optional)* **/Contoso - PedalPerks GTM Plan.docx**  

1. Click **Submit**.  

Researcher will:  

- Combine insights from both internal files and the web.  
- Structure a marketing plan with recommendations on channels and content strategy.  
- Cite sources so you can validate its work.  

> **Note:** Researcher shows its reasoning path (“chain of thought”), and can call other agents when needed.  


# **Copilot Practice**

This quick practice is designed to help you build a strong foundation in prompting. You’ll get hands-on experience with essential techniques and Copilot features, so you can confidently apply what you learn in real business scenarios later. Use this opportunity to experiment, ask questions, and get comfortable with the basics before moving on.


## Practice 1: Generate a Competitive IT Brief

Use Copilot in Word or Teams Chat to quickly research and summarize approaches for deploying Copilot Agents in enterprise environments, focusing on governance and architecture.

**Steps:**
- Open Copilot in Word, Teams, or Loop.
- Use the following prompt to generate your competitive brief:

**Sample Prompt Sequence:**
```text
Build a competitive brief comparing approaches to deploying Copilot Agents in enterprise environments.  
Include sections on governance models, data boundary controls, authentication, and extensibility using  
Microsoft Graph and Azure OpenAI. Summarize lessons learned from early enterprise AI deployments and  
highlight best practices for compliance and lifecycle management.
```
- Review the generated summary and ask follow-up questions such as:
```text
What are the key differences between each governance approach?  
Which model offers the strongest data protection?  
Can you organize the information into a comparison table?  
```
- Refine the structure and tone with a follow-up like:
```text
Reformat this brief into a professional whitepaper outline for IT leadership.  
Include sections: Executive Summary, Architecture Overview, Governance Framework, Security Controls, and Recommendations.
```  
- Save and share your final draft with your IT leadership team or use it as a foundation for your next governance workshop.

> **TIP:** Copilot can synthesize complex technical research into structured, presentation-ready briefs — saving your team hours of manual effort.

## Practice 2: Turn a Meeting into Decisions and Owners

Use Copilot in Teams Meeting Recap to transform meeting discussions into clear outcomes, decisions, and ownership assignments.

**Steps:**
- Open the Meeting Recap tab from your Teams meeting.
- Review the AI-generated summary, notes, and tasks created by Copilot.
- Ask follow-up questions in Copilot Chat, such as:
   ```text
    What were the key decisions made in this meeting?  
    Who owns each follow-up action?  
    Are there any unresolved topics that need escalation or clarification?  
    Summarize all next steps by department or project lead.  
   ```
  - Confirm and edit owners or action items directly in the meeting recap before sharing with attendees.
  - Use Copilot to generate a concise Follow-up Summary ready to send via Teams or email.

> **TIP:** Let Copilot do the heavy lifting — focus on validating decisions, clarifying ownership, and ensuring accountability..

## Practice 3: Summarize and Recap Emails in Outlook

Use Copilot Chat in Outlook to extract key requests and deadlines from email threads.

**Sample Prompt:**
```text
    Recap my email, show me:
    1. What is being asked
    2. What is being asked of the team
    3. What is being asked directly of me
    List dates and topics in a table.
```

> **TIP:** Extract key actions and deadlines from emails to stay organized.

## Practice 4: Analyze Reviews & Visualize Sentiments

Transform survey or review data into insights and visuals.

**Sample Prompt:**
 ```text
 Analyze the “Reviews” column in the attached CSV. Provide sentiment analysis, top themes, and create a pie chart and word cloud.
 ```

> **TIP:** Analyze qualitative data and create visual summaries.

---

## Practice 5: Visualize Financial Data with Charts & Heat Maps

Create charts and heat maps from sales data.

**Sample Prompts:**
```text
List the visual charts you can create from the sales data and then create those charts.
```
```text
Create a Monthly Revenue Trend chart.
```
```text
Create a "Units Sold Distribution by Sales Channel" pie chart.
```
```text
Create a "Total Revenue by Product" chart.
```
```text
Create a heat map of the most purchased products.
```

> **TIP:** Transform numerical data into visual formats for insights.

# **Scenario Options**

This next section is designed to help you practice and deepen your prompting skills. You can choose to work with Copilot Agents—such as Analyst or Researcher—or use the Copilot Agent to address a real business process. We’ve provided a list of suggested scenarios to inspire you, but if you have a specific challenge or workflow in mind, we highly encourage you to use your own. The goal is to apply what you’ve learned in a way that’s most relevant to your role and objectives.

## Choose a scenario to apply your prompting skills:

- **Scenario 1:** Organizational realignment—create a 60-day plan for a new leader.
- **Scenario 2:** Team performance—build a framework for tracking KPIs and supporting development.
- **Scenario 3:** Select your own business challenge and build an action plan.
