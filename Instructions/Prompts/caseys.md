## Prompting Framework: GCSE

To get the best results from Copilot, use the GCSE framework:

- **Goal**: What do you want Copilot to do?
- **Context**: Why do you need it? Who is involved?
- **Source**: What information or samples should Copilot use?
- **Expectations**: How should Copilot respond? (Format, tone, detail)

**TIP:** If your prompt is too short, you’ll get generic results. If it’s too long, Copilot might miss instructions. Aim for clarity and specificity.
