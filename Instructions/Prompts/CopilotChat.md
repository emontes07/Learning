> **Tips**  
> • Use clear names for prompts (e.g., "Weekly Report Summary").
> • Share the most frequently used prompts with your team to maintain consistency.
> • Regularly review and update saved prompts to keep them relevant.

**Step 2: Access your saved Prompts**

1.  Open Copilot.

## Practice 2: Memory and Customization of Copilot

Copilot Memory offers a more personalized experience when training Copilot based on your previous chats, work profile, custom instructions, and other metadata. This allows Copilot to understand you best and suits your needs.

Copilot Customization uses the information from the Memory of Copilot to create tailored interactions. For example, you can tell Copilot your writing style (tone, preferred length of the usual responses, greetings, or closings), which helps the AI-generated drafts sound more like you.

**Step-by-step guide to adding custom instructions**

**Step 1: Access Copilot**

Open a new browser tab and navigate to [Copilot](m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) (or use your usual method to access Copilot).

**Step 2: Add instructions**

• Click on the settings by selecting “…”

• Open *Settings* and selec *Personalization*.

<img src="../Prompts/Media/ADimage1.png" style="width:5.31319in;height:2.83086in"

## Practice 11 (FYI): Create or Replace an Excel Macro with Copilot

This advanced, **FYI-only** task shows two ways to handle VBA-style calculations using **Copilot Chat**—either by asking Copilot to do the equivalent calculation from an uploaded spreadsheet, or by having Copilot help author/adjust the VBA macro.  
> **Heads-up:** VBA macros don’t run in **Excel for the web**; Copilot Chat can still perform the same calculations from your uploaded workbook.

**How to use it:**  

1. Open a new browser tab and go to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).  
2. Select **Copilot Chat**.  
3. Use one of the options below.

![screenshot showing macro alternatives with Copilot](../Prompts/Media/Task8.png)

**Option 1 – Have Copilot perform the calculation from your file**  

Upload your `Revenue.xlsx` (or similar) and run:

```text
Please create an Excel Macro script that performs the following task:
Calculate the total and average revenue from the "Sales by Product" worksheet.

For Excel web users, execute the equivalent calculation now on the uploaded file and report:
- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue
```

**Option 2 – Ask Copilot to draft/modify the VBA macro**

```text
Write a VBA macro that calculates the total and average revenue from the
"Sales by Product" worksheet and displays the results in a message box.

Now modify the script so it writes:
- Total Revenue to cell J4
- Average Revenue to cell J5
and formats both as currency.
```

> **TIP:**
> Explain what this macro does line by line.
> Convert this macro to a Copilot prompt that performs the same calculation without VBA.
> Add error handling if the sheet or column is missing.”

> **Learning Outcome:**
You’ll understand two practical paths to handle macro-style work: (1) let Copilot Chat run the calculation directly from your uploaded workbook, or (2) have Copilot author or refactor the VBA macro for desktop Excel, including writing results to specific cells.


### Task 10: Create a Job Description & Evaluate a Candidate  

Use **Copilot Chat** to create a professional job description based on web research, define KPIs, and then analyze a candidate’s resume for fit against the role. This task is ideal for HR teams, hiring managers, and recruiters who want to streamline job creation and resume evaluation.

```

> **TIP:**
> Rank the candidate from 1–10 based on fit for the role.
> Identify skill gaps and recommend a training plan if they were hired.
> Generate a scorecard template the hiring board can use for all candidates.

> **Learning Outcome:**
After completing this task, you’ll be able to create a well-structured job description, identify KPIs for a role, and perform a resume gap analysis with Copilot Chat—streamlining your hiring process and improving candidate evaluation consistency.
