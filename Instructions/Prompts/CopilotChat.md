## Legal  

Enhance legal decision-making by gathering insights, conducting legal analysis, and drafting professional communications.  

You'll perform three tasks:  

- Research legal information using **Copilot Researcher**. 
- Research legal information using **Copilot Chat and Try GPT5**.  
- Conduct a legal analysis using **Copilot Chat**.  
- Draft a legal communication using **Copilot in Word**.  

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!  

### Task 1: Research Legal Information  

Using **Copilot Chat**, gather insights on relevant legal topics by analyzing internal sources such as emails, chat history, and SharePoint documentation. Then, broaden your research with industry articles, legal databases, external reports, or relevant case law.  

If you don't have an internal legal matter to research, focus on gathering insights from publicly available sources on a legal topic of your choice, such as **contract law, data privacy, employment law, or compliance requirements.**  

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)
- Select the Researcher agent or "@ mention the agent"

** Sample Prompt** *(if no internal legal topic is available)*:

```text

Research the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA), introduced in April 2024, and prepare a summary for Nordstrom’s Legal department that covers:
1.The scope and applicability of APRA to large consumer-goods companies.

2.Key obligations around transparency, data minimization, security, and impact assessments.

3. Required changes to Nordstom’s current data-collection, consent-management, and privacy-governance processes.

4. Recommended Copilot-enabled tools and workflows to automate compliance, including data mapping, policy generation, and ongoing monitoring.

```


### Task 2: Research Legal Information  

Using **Copilot Chat**, gather insights on relevant legal topics by analyzing internal sources such as emails, chat history, and SharePoint documentation. Then, broaden your research with industry articles, legal databases, external reports, or relevant case law.  

If you don't have an internal legal matter to research, focus on gathering insights from publicly available sources on a legal topic of your choice, such as **contract law, data privacy, employment law, or compliance requirements.**  

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)

```

> **NOTE:** Replace bracketed text ([ ]) with your chosen legal topic before submitting the prompt.

### Task 3: Conduct a Legal Analysis  

Using **Copilot Chat**, conduct a structured legal analysis that examines key provisions, implications, and potential risks. Identify common legal challenges and compare how similar organizations or industries approach these issues. Summarize the most critical takeaways to support legal decision-making.  

**Sample Prompt**:

```text
Analyze [specific legal topic] by summarizing its key provisions, potential risks, and business implications. Identify common legal challenges organizations face and compare how similar industries approach compliance and risk mitigation. Highlight key trends and assess potential impacts to provide a well-rounded understanding of its significance.
```

> **NOTE:** Replace bracketed text ([ ]) with your chosen legal topic before submitting the prompt.

> **TIP**

### Task 3: Draft a Legal Communication  

Using **Copilot in Word**, draft a legal communication based on your research and analysis. This could be a legal memo, risk assessment, compliance guidance, client advisory, or an FAQ document.  

**Steps**:

- Launch Microsoft Word from your browser [word.new](https://word.new) or use the desktop application.  
- Enter your prompt where it says **"Describe what you'd like to write"**.
