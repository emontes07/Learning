### Task 1: Perform Online Research & Analysis  

Using **Copilot Chat**, gather insights on relevant topics by analyzing internal sources such as emails, chat history, and SharePoint documentation. Then, broaden your research with industry articles, external reports, or relevant websites.  

If you don't have a specific topic to research, focus on gathering insights from publicly available sources on a topic of your choice, such as **technology trends, market insights, customer experience, or compliance requirements.**  

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)
- Select the Researcher agent or "@mention" the agent in chat

Financial Events:
- Economic indicators (e.g., employment rates, inflation, GDP growth)
- Major business developments (e.g., new businesses opening, closures, expansions)
- Changes in consumer spending habits

Weather Events:

- Recent and upcoming severe weather events (e.g., storms, hurricanes, heatwaves)
- Impact of weather on local infrastructure and transportation

Please provide detailed information and relevant data sources for each aspect to support strategic decision-making for store operations.
```

**TIP**: If the first response is too broad or too shallow, refine your prompt by adding more context (e.g., specific region, industry, or time frame).

After completing this task, you'll be able to use Copilot Chat to perform structured online research and gather actionable insights.

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)
