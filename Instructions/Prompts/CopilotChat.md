4. Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)  
5. Select Copilot Chat and upload your `.csv` file  
6. Use the following sample prompt to analyze and visualize the data.  

![screenshot showing sentiment analysis pie chart and word cloud](../Prompts/Media/Task4.png)  

**Sample Prompt** *(after uploading your CSV file)*:

```text
For each review, analyze the whole sentence and provide a sentiment analysis.  
List the top 10 sentiments with counts based on reviews using the attached file. Analyze the column “Reviews” located in column C.

Then, list the sentiment with counts on reviews and the top 10 themes in the reviews.  
Create a pie graph with Easter-themed colors based on the sentiment count and then create a word cloud based on themes and mentions.
```


> **TIP:**  If you want to customize the visuals further, follow up with questions like: Can you provide a downloadable version of the word cloud? Can you generate a more vibrant color scheme for the pie chart? What software can I use to recreate these visuals manually?

> **Learning Outcome:** 
After completing this task, you’ll be able to analyze qualitative data from reviews or survey feedback, extract themes and sentiment, and create visual summaries with Copilot Chat.

### Task 8 (FYI): Create or Replace an Excel Macro with Copilot

This advanced, **FYI-only** task shows two ways to handle VBA-style calculations using **Copilot Chat**—either by asking Copilot to do the equivalent calculation from an uploaded spreadsheet, or by having Copilot help author/adjust the VBA macro.  
> **Heads-up:** VBA macros don’t run in **Excel for the web**; Copilot Chat can still perform the same calculations from your uploaded workbook.

**How to use it:**  

1. Open a new browser tab and go to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).  
2. Select **Copilot Chat**.  
3. Use one of the options below.

![screenshot showing macro alternatives with Copilot](../Prompts/Media/Task8.png)

**Option 1 – Have Copilot perform the calculation from your file**  

Upload your `Revenue.xlsx` (or similar) and run:

```text
Please create an Excel Macro script that performs the following task:
Calculate the total and average revenue from the "Sales by Product" worksheet.

For Excel web users, execute the equivalent calculation now on the uploaded file and report:
- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue
```

**Option 2 – Ask Copilot to draft/modify the VBA macro**

```text
Write a VBA macro that calculates the total and average revenue from the
"Sales by Product" worksheet and displays the results in a message box.

Now modify the script so it writes:
- Total Revenue to cell J4
- Average Revenue to cell J5
and formats both as currency.
```

> **TIP:**
> Explain what this macro does line by line.
> Convert this macro to a Copilot prompt that performs the same calculation without VBA.
> Add error handling if the sheet or column is missing.”

> **Learning Outcome:**
You’ll understand two practical paths to handle macro-style work: (1) let Copilot Chat run the calculation directly from your uploaded workbook, or (2) have Copilot author or refactor the VBA macro for desktop Excel, including writing results to specific cells.


### Task 9: Create a Job Description & Evaluate a Candidate  

Use **Copilot Chat** to create a professional job description based on web research, define KPIs, and then analyze a candidate’s resume for fit against the role. This task is ideal for HR teams, hiring managers, and recruiters who want to streamline job creation and resume evaluation.

**Steps**:  

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/)  
2. Select **Copilot Chat**.  
3. Start by asking Copilot to research and build a job profile.  
4. Then, upload a candidate’s resume (in `.docx` format) and ask Copilot to perform a gap analysis.

![screenshot showing job description workflow and resume evaluation](../Prompts/Media/Task9.png)

**Sample Prompt** *(Step 1 – Build the job description)*:

```text
In a table format perform a web analysis for a "data analyst" role for finance to include:
- Industry job titles

Finally, based on the above information, write a job description with a competitive salary based on years of experience. This job description will serve as the guide for our hiring board.
```

> **TIP:**
> Rank the candidate from 1–10 based on fit for the role.
> Identify skill gaps and recommend a training plan if they were hired.
> Generate a scorecard template the hiring board can use for all candidates.

> **Learning Outcome:**
After completing this task, you’ll be able to create a well-structured job description, identify KPIs for a role, and perform a resume gap analysis with Copilot Chat—streamlining your hiring process and improving candidate evaluation consistency.
