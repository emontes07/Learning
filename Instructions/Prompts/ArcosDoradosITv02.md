## Practice 1: Generate a Competitive IT Brief

Prepare for a real or simulated IT security initiative by researching how to avoid data oversharing and secure a Microsoft 365 Tenant.

You'll perform three tasks:  

- Gather customer insights using **Copilot Chat**.  
- Draft a positioning strategy using **Copilot in Word**.  
- Create a campaign overview deck using **Copilot in PowerPoint**.  

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started. Feel free to personalize them to suit your needs—be creative and explore! If Copilot doesn’t deliver the result you want, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process and have fun experimenting!  

### Task 1: Conduct security research  

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**, research best practices to prevent oversharing of data and improve tenant security posture. Focus on identifying common risks, policy recommendations, and tools available in Microsoft 365 to strengthen data governance.

**Steps**:

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [M365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com/).  
- Ensure the **Web mode** tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

**Sample Prompt**:  

```text
I’m preparing an internal IT security brief on how to avoid oversharing and secure our Microsoft 365 tenant.  
Please summarize key recommendations related to data governance, access control, and sensitivity labels.  
Include best practices using Microsoft Purview, Conditional Access, and SharePoint/OneDrive external sharing controls.  
Highlight recent security trends or common misconfigurations that could expose sensitive information.
```

> **TIP:** If Copilot’s answer is too broad, refine your prompt by mentioning your organization’s focus area, such as Teams collaboration, SharePoint data sharing, or guest access management.

## Practice 2: Turn a Meeting into Decisions and Owners

Use Copilot in Teams Meeting Recap to transform meeting discussions into clear outcomes, decisions, and ownership assignments.

**Steps:**

- Ask follow-up questions in Copilot Chat, such as:
   ```text
    What were the key decisions made in this meeting?  
    Who owns each follow-up action?  
    Are there any unresolved topics that need escalation or clarification?  
    Summarize all next steps by department or project lead.  
   ```
  - Confirm and edit owners or action items directly in the meeting recap before sharing with attendees.
  - Use Copilot to generate a concise Follow-up Summary ready to send via Teams or email.

> **TIP:** Let Copilot do the heavy lifting — focus on validating decisions, clarifying ownership, and ensuring accountability..

# **Scenario Options**

This next section is designed to help you practice and deepen your prompting skills. You can choose to work with Copilot Agents—such as Analyst or Researcher—or use the Copilot Agent to address a real business process. We’ve provided a list of suggested scenarios to inspire you, but if you have a specific challenge or workflow in mind, we highly encourage you to use your own. The goal is to apply what you’ve learned in a way that’s most relevant to your role and objectives.

## Choose a scenario to apply your prompting skills:

- **Scenario 1:** Organizational realignment—create a 60-day plan for a new leader.
- **Scenario 2:** Team performance—build a framework for tracking KPIs and supporting development.
- **Scenario 3:** Select your own business challenge and build an action plan.
